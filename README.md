GameOfLife

This is my implementation about the Game Of Life developed on python using Qt (PyQt)

Enjoy It!!!

==========

The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

How to use it:

Install Python and PIP

Run 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run
```
python Main.py
```
